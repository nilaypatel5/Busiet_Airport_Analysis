# Busiest Airports by Passenger Traffic (2022)

This project analyzes global air traffic trends by examining the busiest airports in 2022. Using a clean dataset and Python-based visualization techniques, it provides insights into passenger traffic distribution, geospatial patterns, and key airport statistics.

## Features
- **Dataset Overview:** Initial exploration, data cleaning, and summary statistics.
- **Visualizations:**
  - Geospatial scatter plot for airport locations.
  - Pie charts for categorical data distributions.
  - Histograms for numerical data.
  - Correlation heatmap for numeric relationships.
- **Key Insights:** Identification of top airports and countries by passenger traffic.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains the following information:
- **Airport names and locations** (latitude/longitude).
- **Passenger traffic for 2022.**
- **Country and region details.**

### Dataset Enhancements:
- Removal of unnecessary columns for clarity.
- Addition of latitude/longitude for geospatial analysis.

**Note:** The dataset used in this project is sourced from **Kaggle**, and it contains detailed information on the busiest airports worldwide by passenger traffic for 2022. The dataset was cleaned and modified to suit the analysis needs.

## Tools and Libraries
This project uses the following Python libraries:
- `pandas` – For data manipulation and analysis.
- `matplotlib` & `seaborn` – For data visualization.
- `numpy` – For numerical computations.

## Visualizations
1. **Geospatial Scatter Plot:**
   - Displays airport locations based on longitude and latitude.
   - Bubble size represents passenger traffic.
  
2. **Correlation Heatmap:**
   - Highlights relationships between numerical variables.

3. **Category-Based Pie Charts:**
   - Shows the distribution of top airports and countries.

4. **Histograms:**
   - Analyzes the distribution of passenger traffic and rankings.
